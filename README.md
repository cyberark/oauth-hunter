## Overview
oauth-hunter is a powerful tool designed for intercepting and analyzing OAuth requests using mitmproxy.   
It captures OAuth requests and performs comprehensive testing on the redirect_uri parameter, evaluating it against a variety of scenarios to identify potential vulnerabilities. 
This allows users to ensure the robustness of their OAuth implementations and safeguard against common security issues.  

In addition to its current capabilities, we are actively working on expanding the tool's functionality to include testing the state parameter, among other enhancements.   
This ongoing development aims to provide a more thorough analysis of OAuth implementations, ensuring robust security and resilience against common vulnerabilities.
